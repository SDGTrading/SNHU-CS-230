Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design? What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
  The client for this project was The Gaming Room. The client had a game, Draw It or Lose It, that was on android operating systems and wanted to expand to other platforms. I felt that one of the things I did well in development was keeping my software design template simple and on task.
  
What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
  Working through a design document allowed me to stay focused on key information and include only what was required.
  
If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
  If I were to revise one part of this document it would be the Summary/Design constraints. I feel at the start of this project I did not fully understand requirements vs design constraints.
  
How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
  It is important to focus on user's needs when designing because if the user does not like the product, has difficulty using it, or feels their information is not secure they will not use the product for long. In this situation, a game application, the product can only grow if more users are downloading and playing the game.
  
How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
  In the future I plan to work towards a better understanding of requirements, design constraints, and operating systems. I feel these topics will play a key role in future projects going smoothly.
